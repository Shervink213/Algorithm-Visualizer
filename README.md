# Algorithm-Visualizer

<<<<<<< HEAD
A personal project of mine
It visualizes algorithms (and later data structures) given the algorithm and speed
I made it to get a better understanding of algorithms and for review later on if I forget something
=======
This branch is for updating any bugs in the algorithms and implementing new algorithms as to not mess up the main branch
